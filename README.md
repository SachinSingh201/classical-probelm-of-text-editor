The classic text editor problem is a common data structures and algorithms (DSA) challenge that demonstrates the practical application of stacks. It involves implementing basic text editing operations with undo/redo functionality.

Let me provide a clear example of how your text editor works with a step-by-step breakdown:

Let's use the example that's already in your code: `text_editor('kolkata', 'uurruru')`

Here's what happens at each step:

### Initial State:
- Text: "kolkata"
- Pattern: "uurruru"
- Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't', 'a'] (with 'a' at the top)
- Redo Stack (r): [] (empty)

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. Command: 'u' (first character in pattern)
   - Pop 'a' from undo stack and push to redo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't']
   - Redo Stack (r): ['a']

2. Command: 'u' (second character in pattern)
   - Pop 't' from undo stack and push to redo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a']
   - Redo Stack (r): ['a', 't']

3. Command: 'r' (third character in pattern)
   - Pop 't' from redo stack and push to undo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't']
   - Redo Stack (r): ['a']

4. Command: 'r' (fourth character in pattern)
   - Pop 'a' from redo stack and push to undo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't', 'a']
   - Redo Stack (r): [] (empty)

5. Command: 'u' (fifth character in pattern)
   - Pop 'a' from undo stack and push to redo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't']
   - Redo Stack (r): ['a']

6. Command: 'r' (sixth character in pattern)
   - Pop 'a' from redo stack and push to undo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't', 'a']
   - Redo Stack (r): [] (empty)

7. Command: 'u' (seventh character in pattern)
   - Pop 'a' from undo stack and push to redo stack
   - Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't']
   - Redo Stack (r): ['a']

### Final State:
- Undo Stack (u): ['k', 'o', 'l', 'k', 'a', 't']
- Redo Stack (r): ['a']

### Result Construction:
The function then pops all characters from the undo stack to construct the final result:
- Pop 't' → "t"
- Pop 'a' → "at"
- Pop 'k' → "kat"
- Pop 'l' → "lkat"
- Pop 'o' → "olkat"
- Pop 'k' → "kolkat"

So the final output is "kolkat" (the original "kolkata" with the final 'a' remaining in the redo stack).

This example demonstrates how the text editor performs a series of undo and redo operations to manipulate text using stack operations.
